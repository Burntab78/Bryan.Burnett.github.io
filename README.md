# Welcome to Bryan Burnett's GitHub page created for my Capstone project at Southern New Hampshire University.  

The assignment was to create a final project from a previous class projects and enhance them in three areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

I chose to enhance tow projects. Both projects encompassed software design, data structures and algorithms, as well as databases. For my first project, I focused on the software design, structures and algorithms elements. The first project was and ATM Python project from IT 140: Intro to Scripting. This project was simple utilizing only three functions. I enhanced the project by adding new functionality, security, and imporved upon the code to make it more efficient.

The second project focused on the databases element. This project was demonstrating a series of queries to manage a database from my DAD 220: Intro to SQL course. In this project I created a database with tables, updated and removed data from them. I enhanced the project by adding new functionality, and utilized more advanced SQL methods to query the database. Comments were updated to describe what the code was to do as well. 

More information on my enhancements, including an initial code review, can be found at my GitHub Page.
